1 Create a table (in e.g. your bi schema) with the name employee containing the columns id, name and business unit. Let the id hold the primary key, and ensure that a new value is automatically inserted in this column when values in name and business unit is inserted. Insert 4 rows in this table (you can decide what the values should be).
2 Create a table with the name employee contact containing the columns employee id, phone and email. Let the employee id hold the primary key. Also, specify a foreign key from employee id that references the id column in the employee table.
3 Insert one row of values in the employee contact table that maintain referential integrity with the employee table. Which values of employee id in the employee contact table would not be allowed in your table?
4 Which tables in the dvdrental schema have composite primary keys?
5 Find two identifying relations and one non-identifying mandatory relation in the dvdrental schema.
6 What kind of relationship would we have between film.langauge id and language.language id if film.langauge id where allowed to have null values?
7 Consider the many-to-many relation depicted on slide 20. Write these tables in your bi schema, but also include the book ”Database Systems for real” and assume it is authored by Ramez Elmasri and Thomas Nield.
8 Write SQL queries such that you reproduce the tables, constraints, and values given below. Hint: Consider the order in which you create tables and remember that a black dot in a relation in the ER diagram signifies the location of the foreign key.
9 Note: This exercise is challenging but insightful, focusing on database normalization principles. Completing it is beneficial but not crucial. Please give it a try and do your best: A coworker has begun registration of employees, their units, and potential customers in a table. You can find the coworkers script for constructing the table at brightspace: ”Learning Material” → ”SQL in Practice II” → ”initial leads table.sql”. Currently, the only restriction on the table is that the ”employee id” column holds the primary key. The purpose is to be able to link employees in terms of their contact with a potential customer (i.e. the leads). For example, the initial table shows that the employee John Smith is within the ’Sales’ unit (the sales unit is located in ’Aarhus’), and he is the lead responsible for the contact with ’Danske Commodities’. Another example is Jane Morgan and Vicka Adams who are both leads on the potential customer ’Copenhagen Economics’, but Vicki Adams has the main responsibility for this contact. The relationship between the potential customers and the employees should be a many-to-many relationship. Your job is to bring the initial table into the Third Normal Form.
